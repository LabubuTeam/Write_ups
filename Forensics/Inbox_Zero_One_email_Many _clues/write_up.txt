Q1: What is the recipient's email address?

Return-Path: <noreply@paypal-secure.com>
Delivered-To: sarah.mitchell@techcorp.io
Received: from mx2.techcorp.io

from the first 3 lines we can know that the recipient is "sarah.mitchell@techcorp.io"

Q2: What company/brand is being impersonated?

in line 27 we can find this From: "PayPal Security Center" <service@paypal.com>

wich leads us to "Paypal"

Q3: What is the MIME boundary identifier?

First we need to know what does MIME boundary identifier means



MIME boundary identifier refers to a unique string used to separate distinct parts within a multipart MIME message.  It is defined in the Content-Type header of the message using the boundary parameter, such as boundary="----boundary_string". This identifier is crucial for structuring and parsing multipart content.

Each part of the message begins with -- followed by the boundary string.
The final part is terminated by the boundary string followed by --.
The boundary string must not appear anywhere within the content of the message parts, as it serves as a delimiter.
It must consist of ASCII characters, excluding spaces, control characters, and special characters like ()<>@,;:\\"[]?=.
For example:

Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="----boundary_string"

----boundary_string
Content-Type: text/plain

This is the first part.
----boundary_string
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

Binary data...
----boundary_string--


after this example we can confdently say thst the answer is "------=_Part_67890_123456789.1735041165000"

Q4: What is the X-Mailer header value?


Just as before we need to ask our self what does X-Mailer header value mean?

X-Mailer is an email header field that indicates the email client or software used to compose and send the message, along with its version number if available.

It helps identify the origin of the email, such as Microsoft Outlook, Gmail, Apple Mail, or MailChimp.
For example, an X-Mailer value like X-Mailer: MailChimp Mailer - CIDc40ee845e433f8bc0c14 reveals the email was sent via a MailChimp campaign.
Note: While useful for identification, this header can be spoofed by malicious actors to mimic legitimate senders, so it should not be relied on as definitive proof of authenticity.



we have the answer in line 35 "X-Mailer: MailChimp Spoof Engine v2.8"



Q5: What timezone was the email sent from?


ey Principle
Email headers are read from bottom to top in terms of time flow.
The last Received: header is actually the first hop — the original sender’s mail server.

"+0300"

it is just diffrent forms to write the time zone

Q11: Find the hidden email address in the Reply-To header (Base64).

Reply-To header is an email header field that specifies where replies to an email should be sent, independent of the sender's address (From: field).  It ensures that when a recipient clicks "Reply," their response is automatically directed to the designated address, which can be different from the visible From address.


base64: "c3VwcG9ydEBwYXlwYWwtc2VjdXJlLmNvbQ=="

in line 28 we have found this "Reply-To: c3VwcG9ydEBwYXlwYWwtc2VjdXJlLmNvbQ==@notifications.sender.net"



decoding the base 64 wil get us the answer "support@paypal-secure.com"
